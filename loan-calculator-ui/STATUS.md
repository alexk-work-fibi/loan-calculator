# Loan Calculator Status

## Current Status

The loan calculator application is fully functional and fixed. The application now:

1. Properly calculates loan payments based on loan amount, interest rate, and term
2. Correctly displays payment schedules in a table format
3. Visualizes payment data with charts
4. API communication is working as expected with proper JSON format

## Recent Fixes

### API Communication Issue

Previously, the application had an issue with API responses from the `/payments` endpoint. The data returned was showing as "etail, demo.Models.MonthlyPaymentDetail" instead of properly formatted JSON. The root causes were:

1. The Angular HTTP client wasn't setting the proper `Accept` header for JSON responses
2. The parameter case in GET requests was incorrect (using PascalCase instead of camelCase)
3. The API controller lacked explicit content type configuration

### Solutions Applied

1. Added `Accept: application/json` header to Angular HTTP requests:
```typescript
const headers = new HttpHeaders({
  'Accept': 'application/json',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
});
```

2. Changed query parameter casing to lowercase to match ASP.NET Core binding conventions:
```typescript
const params = {
  loanAmount: Number(request.LoanAmount).toString(),
  interestRate: Number(request.InterestRate).toString(),
  termInYears: Number(request.TermInYears).toString()
};
```

3. Added `[Produces("application/json")]` attribute to the C# controller:
```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
[Produces("application/json")]
public class LoanCalculatorController : ControllerBase
```

## Testing

### E2E Tests

End-to-end tests have been implemented using:
- Selenium WebDriver for browser automation
- Jasmine for test assertions
- Chrome in headless mode for test execution

The tests verify:
1. That the UI correctly calculates and displays loan payment information
2. That the payment schedule table contains properly formatted data (and not serialization errors)
3. Direct API responses to ensure proper JSON formatting
4. Different loan calculation scenarios with varying inputs

### Running Tests

To run the E2E tests:

```bash
cd /Users/alexk/Projects/demo/loan-calculator-ui
npm run test:e2e
```

This will:
1. Check if the API and Angular app are running
2. Perform an API health check to verify response format
3. Run the E2E test suite

## Next Steps

1. Add more comprehensive error handling throughout the application
2. Implement additional unit tests for components and services
3. Add validation for edge cases in loan calculations
4. Enhance the UI with more interactive features
